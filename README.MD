# Program Advisory Tool
The goal of this tool is to help students find a pathway to completion for their degree, at any stage of their studies. 

#### The Basic Use-Case Is:
Student selects a degree and major, and provides the courses that they have already completed. The system auto-completes as much as possible the pathway to graduation. Incomplete parts can be completed by the student manually, and the system checks if the selection of courses is valid.
