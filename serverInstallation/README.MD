# MongoDB installation and Setup Instructions
### Installing the server:
To run the server, you will need to install mongoDB using one of the given methods here:
https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/#mongodb-installation-tutorials

Installing using docker is probably the easiest method and allows mongoDB to be entirely removed easily if you are finished with it. Note that if using docker to install, you must install docker itself if it is not already installed. 

**To reiterate: Docker is the preferred method for ease of use and access.**

### MongoDB Shell (mongosh):

No matter what version you install, you will also need to install mongosh - a CLI tool for accessing and connecting to a mongoDB database.

Tutorial for installing mongosh available here:

### MongoDB Compass:

It is also recommended to download and install mongoDB Compass to provide a GUI for CRUD operations on the database.
